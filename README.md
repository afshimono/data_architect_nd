# Projects of the Data Architect ND

## Designing an HR database

### Project Overview

In this project, you will design, build, and populate a database for the Human Resources (HR) Department at the imaginary Tech ABC Corp, a video game company. This project will start with a request from the HR Manager. From there, you will need to design a database using the foundational principals of data architecture that is best suited to the department's needs. You will go through the steps of database architecture, creating database proposals, database entity relationship diagrams (ERD), and finally creating the database itself. This project is important, as it is a scaled-down simulation of the kind of real-world assignments data architects work on every day.

### Proposed solution

After many interactions, the proposed solution is as follows:
